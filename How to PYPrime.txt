How to PYPrime, rev. 1

PYPrime 2 is a memory benchmark that scales with latency, the exact scaling end behaviour will vary depending on the architecture used.
In general you should get as high of a clock as possible (with a catch) then tune timings and sub timings.
PYPrime also scales with CPU and Cache clock, this should not be your first priority though
